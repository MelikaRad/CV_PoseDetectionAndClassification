# Pose Detection and Classification
Detecting and classifying poses of a person in an input image or video frames,
in python using OpenCV library and other frameworks.
  
In this project, we first detect the landmarks of the person's body,  
and then classify their poses using different approaches.
  
Here are different libraries used for pose detection step:   
1. Mediapipe's pose detection module  
2. OpenPose pose detection library   (to do next)
